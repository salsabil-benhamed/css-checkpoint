           the vast oceans, to decide when plant their crops and to answer
           questions of where we come from end how we got here.  It is a
           discpline that opens our eyes, gives context to our place in the
           universe and that can reshape how we see the world.

          and theories about the nature. Once you enter this world full of myqteries you will
          never wanna leave it 
          Another thing is that astronomy is all about the future. In fact; scientists are planning
          to create a new life on other planets for the next generations, since owr planet is poluted
          and gradually destroyed, having a new habited seems to be the perfect alternative. 
          That beeing said; March is the best hope for us now.</h3></li>
       <h3><li>Beeing an astronaut is quite a hard mission; it's not as simple as you think, 
         neighter as I imagine. It requires a genies level, an exellent background and above all 
         courage and determination since it's a risky job. </li></h3>
